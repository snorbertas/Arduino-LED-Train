# Arduino LED Train

This is my first Arduino project using C++. The code programs the board to create various patterns using 10 LED (or whatever desired amount) lights. Here's a video demonstrating it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8az_PUpH-Qc

The physical components used:
  - Arduino UNO board
  - 10 LED lights
  - 11 resistors (x10 220 ohm, x1 10 ohm)
  - 1 Button
  - 1 Analog potentiometer
  - 17 wires
  
If you want to attempt to rebuild it yourself. The default pins used in my code are as follows:
  - Analog #1: Sensor INPUT
  - Digital #3: Button INPUT
  - Digital #4 to #13: LED OUTPUT

Big thanks to Andrew and his genius son who supplied me with the components to play around with and gave me a quick introduction on how Arduino works :)
